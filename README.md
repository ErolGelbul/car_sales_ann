<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About

A model that predicts how much the customer will potentially pay when purchasing a new car.

If you would like more information on the project, please check out my [blog post](https://erolgelbul.com/project-blog/car-sales).

## Evaluations

* Since this is a prediction and it is a continual value (purchase amount) the problem at hand is a regression problem.
* After 20 epochs the error dropped significantly. If the model is limited to 30 epochs instead of a 100, that will be more efficient.

<!-- TECH -->
## Computing Platform

I used [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). I recommend installing Anaconda.

### Create an account:

First create an account on [Anaconda Cloud](https://anaconda.org)

### Install the client:

#### With Conda (recommended):

```
$ conda install anaconda-client
```

#### With pip:

```
pip install anaconda-client
```

#### With pip from source:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/Anaconda-Server/anaconda-client
```

### Login

`$ anaconda login`

Test your login with the whoami command:

`$ anaconda whoami`

For a complete tutorial on building and uploading Conda packages to Anaconda Cloud visit the [documentation page](http://docs.anaconda.org/).
